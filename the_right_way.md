# The Right Way
> how to build and operate teams and software

### If you want to survive...

```
"[Your] highest priority is to satisfy the customer
 through early and continuous delivery
 of valuable software."
 
"Build projects around motivated individuals.
 Give them the environment and support they need,
 and trust them to get the job done."
  
"Working software is the primary measure of progress."
 
"Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
 of work not done--is essential."

"The best architectures, requirements, and designs
 emerge from self-organizing teams."
  
              - Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
```

```
"Adding manpower to a late software project, makes it later."
                                    - Frederick P. Brooks Jr.
```

### If you want to excel...

```
"...maintain an extremely high bar for the quality of what [you] create and how [you] interact, 
 and [don't] sacrifice that for quantity of output."
 
                                                                                       - Stripe
